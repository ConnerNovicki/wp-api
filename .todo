TODO:
  - Verify email endpoint that takes a token (somehow hashed to avoid sending the straightforward verifyToken as token) and marks user in DB as verified if matches
    - Add new salt for email tokens specifically
  - Forgot password endpoint, send email to user that allows them to reset password
  - AppError more robust to auto-log possibly?
  - Testing?
  - Pre-commit or pre-push hook for tsc check?
  - Fix sendgrid token to be in env instead
  - API endpoint docs somehow? For input -> output?
    - Currently no typing for returns of endpoints. DONT KNOW how to do this yet... but, automate automate automate.
  - Setup basics of translations?

Technologies to use:
  - Sendinblue for emails... instead of sendgrid
